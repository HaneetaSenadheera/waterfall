  <p>An hour away from Ella, Diyaluma Falls is the second-highest among the waterfalls in Sri Lanka. The waterfall tumbles down from a height of a whopping 220 meters, with several beautiful natural infinity pools at different levels along its length. Diyaluma Falls forms along the Poonagala Oya, a minor tributary of the river Kirindi Oya. The highlight of Diyaluma Falls is the hike to its top, swimming in the serene pools, and the magnificent views of the emerald hills.</p>
